<h3>Software evolves towards some goals.</h3>
>> Take pied piper, the evolution of the software was based on the 
constantly changing fuckups they had to endure. I'm sure they're some 
real world examples out there, but I'm too tired right now to search.

<b><u>Conclusion:</u></b>
<p>If you are lacking in motivation to work on that software, just set some goals for it.
For example, what would it take to get this app on the Playstore; you then go on to work towards that.
Why is "just" so easy to set some goals? 
1. Software always has some purpose - whether it's to pass time or learn something new or solve world hunger.
They could also be software made to proof this point wrong, which would actually prove this point right :).
So to keep working on a software have a goal for it. 

All this not being the same as you're fucking burnt out. If you are burnt out, then you don't lack motiviation - 
you're fucking tired!! I'm sorry that's beyond the scope of this shit post -- but! But!! Take a day or 2 off 
or maybe learn how to win your favourite ps4 game using cheat codes of course!
